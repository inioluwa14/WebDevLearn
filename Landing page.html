        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka".
            The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (plakous), which was derived from the word for "flat", πλακόεις (plakoeis). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. 
            They also had a cake called "satura", which was a flat heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became "placenta" 
            which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case
