Some important things to note when using git/github

1) git --version(what version of git is installed)
2) change directory to folder where code is located
3) git init(initialises repository in code folder)
4) git status(checks status of current files within code folder as concerns git repo)
5) git add . (adds all untracked changes to repo)
6) git commit -m "message" (commits changes to repo with message)
7) git push -u origin main (commits repo to online git)
8) git reset (removes files from stages before commit)
